Hello from Dave W!

app.js
You can put all the code on the page inside the document ready function so you don't have to do a double function call upon ready.
(move event handler into document ready)

Honestly the code looks pretty good.  They have a ton of information they need to parse from the maps api, and it's hard to get a hold on how it all fits together in the few minutes I had to look at it.
